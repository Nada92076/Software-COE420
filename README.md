            <h2>What Led Me to This Degree</h2>
            <p>I wasn't entirely sure what I wanted to do at first, so I explored a few options. When I looked into computer engineering, it felt like the most interesting choice. The mix of problem-solving and technology really caught my attention and made it the right fit for me.

            <h2>Hobbies and Special Interests</h2>
            <p>I enjoy staying active by participating in spin classes, which help me stay fit while also offering an energizing challenge.

        <section class="course">
            <h2>Reasons for Taking COE 420 </h2>
            <p>I take this course because it is the only one that truly bridges the gap between academic learning and the real-world applications we will face in our careers. It offers a unique glimpse into the future by equipping us with the practical skills and knowledge needed for the challenges we will encounter in the industry. Software engineering is not just theoretical—it's a course that brings us closer to our reality, preparing us for the work we’ll be doing after graduation.</p>
